# AI-based-Book-recommendation-System
The task is of building an AI-based nook recommendation system that utilizes customer data to provide personalized and relevant book suggestions. The primary goal of this system is to increase customer satisfaction and sales revenue by improving the shopping experience and helping customers discover new books they are likely to enjoy.
## Dataset:
The ratings dataset contains the following attributes:

* `user-Id`: Unique ID for each user
* `ISBN`: International Standard Book Number. Books are identified by their respective ISBN
* `Book-rating`: Rating for each book expressed on a scale from 0-10

I have also used the books dataset to obtain book titles and other information. It contains the following attributes:

* `ISBN`: International Standard Book Number
* `Book-title`: Title of the book
* `Book-author`: Name of the author
* `Year-of-Publication`: Publication Year
* `Publisher`: Name of the publisher of the book
* `Image-Url-S`: Small image of the book (Amazon link)
* `Image-Url-M`: Medium size image of the book (Amazon link)
* `Image-Url-L`: Large size image of the book (Amazon link)
